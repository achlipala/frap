(* Let's look at another example of what we can model with operational
 * semantics: correctness of compiler transformations.  Our inspiration here is
 * the seminal project CompCert, which uses Coq to verify a realistic C
 * compiler.  We will adopt the same *simulation*-based techniques as CompCert,
 * albeit on a simpler language and with simpler compiler phases.  We'll stick
 * to transformations from the source language to itself, since that's enough to
 * illustrate the big ideas.  Here's the object language that we'll use, which
 * is _almost_ the same as from Chapter 7. *)

Inductive arith : Set :=
| Const (n : nat)
| Var (x : var)
| Plus (e1 e2 : arith)
| Minus (e1 e2 : arith)
| Times (e1 e2 : arith).

Inductive cmd :=
| Skip
| Assign (x : var) (e : arith)
| Sequence (c1 c2 : cmd)
| If (e : arith) (then_ else_ : cmd)
| While (e : arith) (body : cmd)
| Output (e : arith).
(* The last constructor above is the new one, for generating an _output_ value,
 * say to display in a terminal.  By including this operation, we create
 * interesting differences between the behaviors of different nonterminating
 * programs.  A correct compiler should preserve these differences. *)

(* The next span of notations and definitions is the same as from Chapter 7. *)

Coercion Const : nat >-> arith.
Coercion Var : var >-> arith.
Infix "+" := Plus : arith_scope.
Infix "-" := Minus : arith_scope.
Infix "*" := Times : arith_scope.
Delimit Scope arith_scope with arith.
Notation "x <- e" := (Assign x e%arith) (at level 75).
Infix ";;" := Sequence (at level 76). (* This one changed slightly, to avoid parsing clashes. *)
Notation "'when' e 'then' then_ 'else' else_ 'done'" := (If e%arith then_ else_) (at level 75, e at level 0).

Definition valuation := fmap var nat.
Fixpoint interp (e : arith) (v : valuation) : nat :=
  match e with
  | Const n => n
  | Var x =>
    match v $? x with
    | None => 0
    | Some n => n
    end
  | Plus e1 e2 => interp e1 v + interp e2 v
  | Minus e1 e2 => interp e1 v - interp e2 v
  | Times e1 e2 => interp e1 v * interp e2 v
  end.

Inductive context :=
| Hole
| CSeq (C : context) (c : cmd).

Inductive plug : context -> cmd -> cmd -> Prop :=
| PlugHole : forall c, plug Hole c c
| PlugSeq : forall c C c' c2,
  plug C c c'
  -> plug (CSeq C c2) c (Sequence c' c2).

(* Here's our first difference.  We add a new parameter to [step0], giving a
 * _label_ that records which _externally visible effect_ the step has.  For
 * this language, output is the only externally visible effect, so a label
 * records an optional output value.  Including this element makes our semantics
 * a _labelled transition system_. *)

Inductive step0 : valuation * cmd -> option nat -> valuation * cmd -> Prop :=
| Step0Assign : forall v x e,
  step0 (v, Assign x e) None (v $+ (x, interp e v), Skip)
| Step0Seq : forall v c2,
  step0 (v, Sequence Skip c2) None (v, c2)
| Step0IfTrue : forall v e then_ else_,
  interp e v <> 0

| Step0WhileFalse : forall v e body,
  interp e v = 0
  -> step0 (v, While e body) None (v, Skip)
| Step0Output : forall v e,
  step0 (v, Output e) (Some (interp e v)) (v, Skip).

(* It's easy to push labels through steps with context. *)
Inductive cstep : valuation * cmd -> option nat -> valuation * cmd -> Prop :=
| CStep : forall C v c l v' c' c1 c2,
  plug C c c1
  -> step0 (v, c) l (v', c')
  -> plug C c' c2
  -> cstep (v, c1) l (v', c2).

(* To characterize correct compilation, it is helpful to define a relation to
 * capture which output _traces_ a command might generate.  Note that, for us, a
 * trace is a list of output values and/or terminating markers.  We drop silent
 * labels as we run, and we use [Some n] for outputting of [n] and [None] for
 * termination. *)
Inductive generate : valuation * cmd -> list (option nat) -> Prop :=
| GenDone : forall vc,
  generate vc []
| GenSkip : forall v,

  -> generate vc' ns
  -> generate vc ns
| GenOutput : forall vc n vc' ns,
  cstep vc (Some n) vc'
  -> generate vc' ns
  -> generate vc (Some n :: ns).

Hint Constructors plug step0 cstep generate : core.

(* Notice that [generate] is defined so that, for any two of a starting state's
 * traces, one is a prefix of the other.  The same wouldn't necessarily hold if
 * our language were nondeterministic. *)

(* We define trace inclusion to capture the notion of
 * _preserving all behaviors_. *)
Definition traceInclusion (vc1 vc2 : valuation * cmd) :=
  forall ns, generate vc1 ns -> generate vc2 ns.
Infix "<|" := traceInclusion (at level 70).

(* And trace equivalence captures _having the same behaviors_. *)
Definition traceEquivalence (vc1 vc2 : valuation * cmd) :=
  vc1 <| vc2 /\ vc2 <| vc1.
Infix "=|" := traceEquivalence (at level 70).

(* Trace equivalence is an appropriate notion of correctness, to relate the
 * "before" and "after" programs of a compiler transformation.  Note that here
 * we break from our usual modus operandi, as we will not be using invariants to
 * characterize correctness!  This kind of trace equivalence is one of the other
 * big concepts that competes with invariants to unify different correctness
 * notions. *)

(* Here's a simple example program, which outputs how many days have elapsed at
 * the end of each one-month period (with a simplified notion of "month"!). *)

Definition daysPerWeek := 7.
Definition weeksPerMonth := 4.
Definition daysPerMonth := (daysPerWeek * weeksPerMonth)%arith.
(* We are purposely building an expression with arithmetic that can be resolved
 * at compile time, to give our optimizations something to do. *)

Example month_boundaries_in_days :=
  "acc" <- 0;;

    when daysPerMonth then
      "acc" <- "acc" + daysPerMonth;;
      Output "acc"

(* Moderately laboriously, we can prove a particular example trace for this
