| Var (x : string)
| Read (e1 : exp)
| Plus (e1 e2 : exp)

(* Those were the expressions of numeric type.  Here are the Boolean

Inductive bexp :=

| Less (e1 e2 : exp).

Definition heap := fmap nat nat.
Definition valuation := fmap var nat.
Definition assertion := heap -> valuation -> Prop.

(* Here's the syntax of side-effecting commands, where we attach an assertion to
 * every "while" loop, for reasons that should become clear later.  The
 * assertion is ignored in the operational semantics! *)
Inductive cmd :=
| Skip
| Assign (x : var) (e : exp)
| Write (e1 e2 : exp)
| Seq (c1 c2 : cmd)
| If_ (be : bexp) (then_ else_ : cmd)
| While_ (inv : assertion) (be : bexp) (body : cmd)

(* And one more, which we'll use to characterize program correctness more
 * simply: *)
| Assert (a : assertion).

(* Shorthand notation for looking up in a finite map, returning zero if the key
 * is not found *)
Notation "m $! k" := (match m $? k with Some n => n | None => O end) (at level 30).

(** * Hoare logic *)
