(* Coming up with invariants ourselves can be tedious!  Let's investigate how we

 * more deliberately about how to grow a candidate invariant by adding new cases
 * that we missed.  Here's what it means for one invariant to retain all cases of
 * another. *)

(* Now imagine the following general procedure to find an invariant.  Start with

 * to the original set.  (Of course, we must also retain all the initial

(* Now, with the help of a lemma, we prove that multi-step closure is a sound

(** * Modularity *)

(* Throughout the book, we'll come again and again to our two main weapons in
 * soundly modeling complex transition systems with simpler ones.  We just
 * learned about *abstraction*, to replace a full system with a simpler one.
 * The other key one is *modularity*, to replace a system with several others.
 * Let's study one example that helps with model checking, allowing us to check
 * programs with arbitrarily many threads running the same code, while still
 * finding an invariant automatically by brute-force enumeration. *)

(* The key to this particular technique is instrumenting a step relation to
 * consider *interference*, or the actions that other threads might take, in
 * between steps of the thread that we focus on.  This relation is parameterized
 * on an invariant [inv] that the other threads guarantee to preserve on the
 * shared state.  That is, the other threads may mess with the shared state
 * arbitrarily between our own steps, *but* they guarantee that every value they
 * set for it satisfies [inv]. *)
